# Cursor Rules for Excel Agent Development

## Code Style
- Use Python 3.10+ features
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for all functions and classes
- Use meaningful variable and function names

## File Organization
- Keep modules focused and single-purpose
- Place related functionality in appropriate subdirectories
- Use __init__.py files to make packages
- Keep frontend and backend code separate

## Documentation
- Document all public APIs
- Include usage examples in docstrings
- Update README.md with setup and usage instructions
- Comment complex logic and algorithms

## Error Handling
- Use try-except blocks for all external operations
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Log errors with appropriate levels
- Handle edge cases gracefully

## Security
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize file paths to prevent directory traversal
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Never execute user code without proper sandboxing

## Testing
- Write unit tests for core functionality
- Test error cases and edge conditions
- Test with various Excel file structures
- Verify voice input and SSE streaming

## Performance
- Cache processed Excel metadata when possible
- Optimize file reading operations
- Use async/await for I/O operations
- Minimize memory usage for large files
